# BlackJack-Game
I wanted to play BlackJack with my friends and what better way than to play the game made by me ðŸ˜‰.
The first version allows to play against the house. I am working on the second version to incorporate multiple players. 
Also, I will be adding a better UI/UX for the game in the future, so stay tuned. 

Some rules, win conditions and objectives are outlined here:

The Objective of Blackjack
Beat The Dealer.

How do you beat the dealer?

1- By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealerâ€™s hand value
2- By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
3- By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

How do you lose to the dealer? 

1- Your hand value exceeds 21.
2- he dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round
